# Item Database Report (IDR) - Python Build 

Every month, I build an item database report of every entry in our system along with unique and non-unique attributes depending on
the province they are sold in. To build manually with excel, it takes about an hour as there are about 87,000 items and 17 vlookups
required. This takes time and provides room for error. This script pulls the information builds an excel file along with a separate
tab for pricing audits. I have packed this into an exe, giving anyone the ability to run this report on demand and in minutes.
